[ConvMNISTImage.ipynb](https://github.com/oopere/TensorFlowCertification/blob/main/ConvMNISTImage.ipynb)
With 7 models, starting with the most simple model with just two Dense layers. And following with more complicated models using diffent kind of layers. 
The noteboopk is organized in parts:

Common funtions to plot the data. A callback function to stop the learning process whet it reach an appropiate % in  **val_data**. And one function witth all the models inside and their results. 

Differents technis suchs as Data Augmetation, Transfer Learning, Custom Learning Rate...

[IMAGERecog.ipynb](https://github.com/oopere/TensorFlowCertification/blob/main/IMAGERecog.ipynb)
Binary classification problem using the cat & dogs dataset. 

Different convolutiona models executed with and without Data Augmentation. 

Two different samples of Transfer learning with Inceptionv3 and VGG16.
